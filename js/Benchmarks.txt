Benchmarks

var a = performance.now();
for(var i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {map.verticalStreaks();}
var b = performance.now();
console.log('It took ' + (b - a)/1000 + ' s.');

Using a pre-allocated position pool netted 10-30% better results over instanciating positions.

Using a 1d array(+math) vs a 2d array brought benchmark time down from 18s to 11.5s for killables(), and from 10.7s -> 7.8s for verticalStreaks()
